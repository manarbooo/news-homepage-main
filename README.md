## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for interactivity
- [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for creating a smooth navbar animation effect
- **Flexbox**  for layout

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned and improved on several concepts:
- **Using Anime.js**: I implemented smooth animation effects for the navbar, which enhanced the overall user experience. Anime.js was easy to integrate and provided flexible animation options.
- **Responsive Design**: I created a fully responsive layout using CSS flexbox for the main sections and Flexbox for smaller elements. The design adjusts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
- **DOM Manipulation with JavaScript**: I used JavaScript to add interactivity to the navbar and other elements, making the page dynamic.



## Useful Resources

These resources helped me while working on the project:

1. [**Anime.js Documentation**](https://animejs.com/) - Great for learning how to implement animations easily.
2. [**MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - Helped with structuring the layout.
3. [**CSS-Tricks - Flexbox Guide**](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Useful for understanding Flexbox for smaller components.
